## 0. TL;DR (read this first)

- **Product:** `Deskly` — a multi-tenant customer-support / helpdesk SaaS (Zendesk/Intercom-class, Linear-grade UI).
- **Why this project:** maximises coverage of every evaluation axis (RBAC, CRUD, dashboards, analytics, search/filter/sort/paginate, CSV+PDF export, audit log, settings, responsive, docs, deploy). See `MASTER_REQUIREMENTS.md §Project Selection`.
- **Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) · TypeScript strict · TailwindCSS · shadcn/ui · Prisma · SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL/Supabase (prod) · Auth.js v5 · Zod · React Hook Form · TanStack Query · Recharts · Vitest · Playwright.
- **Deployment posture:** *deploy-ready, user deploys.* Everything is one-command deployable (Vercel + Supabase), with env templates, CI, and a deploy guide. No live credentials used in this session.
- **Local DB choice:** SQLite for dev so the app **actually runs and is verified**; documented one-line switch to Postgres for prod (`prisma/README.md`).

## 1. Environment (verified this session)

| Tool   | Version        | Notes                                   |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Node   | v22.18.0       | OK for Next 15                          |
| npm    | 11.6.0         | Package manager (no pnpm available)     |
| git    | 2.50.1.windows | Repo not yet initialised                |
| docker | not installed  | → SQLite for local DB, no local Postgres|
| OS     | Windows 11     | Shell: PowerShell + Git Bash            |

**Implications:** use `npm`, use SQLite locally, avoid Docker-only tooling, keep all scripts cross-platform (no bash-only npm scripts).

## 2. Key decisions & rationale (Decision Log — append only)

| # | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives rejected |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| D1 | Project = Helpdesk SaaS (`Deskly`) | Richest fit for all evaluation axes; reference UX bar (Linear/Intercom) matches the brief | ATS (more complex), Invoicing (narrow RBAC), Todo/Weather/Chat (explicitly banned) |
| D2 | SQLite dev / Postgres prod | Verifiable locally with zero infra; trivial prod switch | Postgres-only (no local DB infra available), Docker (not installed) |
| D3 | Enums as string-union + Zod, not Prisma native enums | SQLite doesn't support native enums; single source of truth in `lib/constants` keeps schema portable | Prisma enums (locks to Postgres, breaks local dev) |
| D4 | Auth.js v5 (credentials + optional OAuth) | Session/JWT, middleware RBAC, works on Vercel edge; credentials keeps demo login frictionless | Clerk/Auth0 (external dependency, less to demonstrate) |
| D5 | Server Actions + Route Handlers hybrid | Actions for mutations (progressive enhancement), Route Handlers for the public REST-ish API + exports | tRPC (adds surface without payoff for a trial) |
| D6 | Multi-tenant via `Organization` | Demonstrates real SaaS data-isolation & maturity | Single-tenant (weaker signal) |
| D7 | TanStack Query for client cache + optimistic updates | Required by brief; pairs with Server Actions for mutations | SWR (fine, but brief names TanStack) |
| D8 | Tenancy enforced in a data-access layer (`lib/dal`) | Every query is org-scoped in one place → no accidental cross-tenant leak | ad-hoc `where` clauses (leak risk) |

- [x] M2: Auth & Tenancy (Auth.js, org-scoped DAL, Seed script)
- [x] M3: App shell & core CRUD (Tickets, Contacts, Auth pages)
- [ ] M4: Dashboard & Analytics
- [ ] M5: Rich Data Tables

- [ ] M7: Settings & RBAC (Team management, audit log viewer)
- [ ] M8: Testing & CI
- [ ] M9: Docs & Deploy (Landing page, Turso, Vercel)

## Current Status (Last Updated: M3)

We have completed **Milestone 3**. The authenticated app shell is in place with a responsive sidebar and topbar. The full authentication flow (login, register, forgot password, reset password, verify email) is functional using server actions and Zod validation. Core CRUD operations for Tickets and Contacts have been implemented with role-based access control (`can()`) and strict tenant isolation via the DAL. All mutations write to the immutable AuditLog. The test suite (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`) passes.

## 5. Assumptions (to reconcile if the real brief arrives)

1. No hard time-box given → optimise for demonstrated breadth + depth, not raw speed.
2. Deployment target is Vercel + Supabase (most common, best DX). Swappable.
3. A single demo Organization is seeded; the model supports many.
4. "Export PDF" = server-generated PDF of the current filtered ticket view + a per-ticket PDF.
5. English-only, no i18n required (structure allows adding it).

---

## 6. How to resume (for a future session)

1. Read this file §3–§4.
2. `npm install` at repo root.
3. `cp .env.example .env` and set `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` + `AUTH_SECRET`.
4. `npm run db:reset` (migrate + seed).
5. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000, log in with the demo creds in `SUBMISSION/README.md`.
6. Continue from the "Next action" in §4.

---

## 7. BRIEF RECONCILIATION (authoritative — supersedes earlier assumptions)

> The real Digital Heroes brief (`Digital_Heroes_Full_Stack_Developer_Trial.pdf`, "The Builder's
> Handbook") was received mid-M0 and read in full. It **validates the stack and approach** and adds
> hard requirements. This section is the source of truth where it conflicts with §0–§6.

**Confirmed by brief:** Next.js App Router · TS strict (no `any`) · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · Postgres
(Supabase/Neon) **or SQLite for simple apps** · Prisma · Auth.js · Zod on every boundary · Vercel ·
TanStack Query / server actions · ESLint+Prettier+Vitest/Playwright+GitHub Actions. Milestone builds,
spec-first, schema-first, 4-states-first, ⌘K palette — all already planned.

**Environment reality (locked after scaffold):** create-next-app installed **Next.js 16.2.10 · React
19.2.4 · Tailwind v4**. Next 16 has breaking changes vs. training data — consult
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing app code. Remove scaffold's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` from
the public repo (reads as AI scaffolding).

**Database (final):** `provider = "sqlite"` committed → zero-service local run for reviewers. Prisma
client uses the **libSQL driver adapter** so production runs on **Turso** (SQLite-compatible,
serverless, persistent, free tier) with the *identical* schema. `docs/deployment.md` also documents the
one-line switch to Postgres/Supabase. Rationale: max verifiability + brief's zero-friction demand +
real persistence on Vercel.

**New decisions from the brief:**

| # | Decision | Driven by brief section |
|---|----------|-------------------------|
| D9  | Roles = **OWNER · ADMIN · AGENT · VIEWER** (4) | §08 "owner/admin/member/viewer" |
| D10 | **Email verification** gates write access; **password reset** via single-use hashed token (20-min TTL, invalidated on use) | §08 Auth & Access |
| D11 | **OAuth Google + GitHub** via Auth.js, lit up when env present; passwords hashed with **bcrypt cost 12** (pure-JS `bcryptjs`, serverless-safe; meets "bcrypt ≥12") | §08 |
| D12 | **Keyset/cursor pagination** on `(sortKey, id)`; default page size 25, hard cap 100 | §08 Finding Data |
| D13 | **Soft-delete** (`deletedAt`) on Ticket; mutations return the mutated record | §08 Data & CRUD |
| D14 | **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) in `next.config`; CSRF via Auth.js + same-site + server-action origin checks | §08 Trust & Safety |
| D15 | **`src/` directory** layout: `src/{app,components,lib,server,types}` | §10 Repo Structure |
| D16 | Full **SEO**: per-route metadata, canonical, robots.ts, sitemap.ts, `opengraph-image.tsx` (ImageResponse 1200×630), Twitter cards, JSON-LD (SoftwareApplication + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList), self-hosted **Inter** via `next/font` | §14 SEO |
| D17 | Public **marketing surface**: real landing page (H1 value prop, features, screenshots, one CTA) + docs pages + FAQ; app lives under `(app)` group behind auth | §14 Content & Discovery |
| D18 | **Streamed** CSV/PDF export (survive 30s gateway); **bulk actions** with select-all-across-pages + confirm; keyboard `⌘K`, `j/k`, `/`, `?` cheat-sheet | §08 Beyond Basics |
| D19 | Deliverables: demo login in README, **credit Digital Heroes**, `docs/case-study.md`, `docs/demo-script.md` (60–90s), tagged **v1.0.0** | §11, §16, §22 |

**Evaluation weights (score budget — spend accordingly, M10):**
Product Quality & Functionality **20** · UI/UX Craft **15** · Code Quality & Architecture **15** ·
Deployment & Reliability **12** · Documentation **10** · GitHub Professionalism **10** ·
SEO & Discoverability **10** · Originality & Attention to Detail **8**.

**Hard rules (non-negotiable):** TS strict · real DB (not localStorage) · real auth · server-side
validation · secrets only in env. **Common-mistake avoidance:** no default README · no single squashed
commit (atomic conventional commits) · deploy survives hard refresh · OG image renders · zero console
errors/warnings · all 4 states everywhere · responsive from 320px · strip AI comments/TODOs/dead code ·
`.env` gitignored · tagged release.

**UI hard specs to hardcode as tokens (§07):** 4/8px spacing · type scale 12/14/16/20/24/32/48 (body
16, lh 1.5, headings 1.2) · radius 8 default /6 inputs /12 cards /9999 pills · tap target ≥44px · AA
contrast 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/UI · app shell ≤1280px, prose ≤680px · motion 150–250ms ease
`cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`, 300ms cap, honor reduced-motion · Inter + mono for numbers · focus ring
2px accent +2px offset on `:focus-visible` · breakpoints 640/768/1024/1280 mobile-first.

**Open decision to raise with user:** commit-trailer AI attribution vs. brief's "own every line" — ask
before finalizing git history.
