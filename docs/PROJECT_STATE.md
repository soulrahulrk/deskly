## 0. TL;DR (read this first)

- **Product:** `Deskly` — a multi-tenant customer-support / helpdesk SaaS (Zendesk/Intercom-class, Linear-grade UI).
- **Why this project:** maximises coverage of every evaluation axis (RBAC, CRUD, dashboards, analytics, search/filter/sort/paginate, CSV+PDF export, audit log, settings, responsive, docs, deploy). See `MASTER_REQUIREMENTS.md §Project Selection`.
- **Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) · TypeScript strict · TailwindCSS · shadcn/ui · Prisma · SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL/Supabase (prod) · Auth.js v5 · Zod · React Hook Form · TanStack Query · Recharts · Vitest · Playwright.
- **Deployment posture:** *deploy-ready, user deploys.* Everything is one-command deployable (Vercel + Supabase), with env templates, CI, and a deploy guide. No live credentials used in this session.
- **Local DB choice:** SQLite for dev so the app **actually runs and is verified**; documented one-line switch to Postgres for prod (`prisma/README.md`).

## 1. Environment (verified this session)

| Tool   | Version        | Notes                                   |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Node   | v22.18.0       | OK for Next 15                          |
| npm    | 11.6.0         | Package manager (no pnpm available)     |
| git    | 2.50.1.windows | Repo not yet initialised                |
| docker | not installed  | → SQLite for local DB, no local Postgres|
| OS     | Windows 11     | Shell: PowerShell + Git Bash            |

**Implications:** use `npm`, use SQLite locally, avoid Docker-only tooling, keep all scripts cross-platform (no bash-only npm scripts).

## 2. Key decisions & rationale (Decision Log — append only)

| # | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives rejected |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| D1 | Project = Helpdesk SaaS (`Deskly`) | Richest fit for all evaluation axes; reference UX bar (Linear/Intercom) matches the brief | ATS (more complex), Invoicing (narrow RBAC), Todo/Weather/Chat (explicitly banned) |
| D2 | SQLite dev / Postgres prod | Verifiable locally with zero infra; trivial prod switch | Postgres-only (no local DB infra available), Docker (not installed) |
| D3 | Enums as string-union + Zod, not Prisma native enums | SQLite doesn't support native enums; single source of truth in `lib/constants` keeps schema portable | Prisma enums (locks to Postgres, breaks local dev) |
| D4 | Auth.js v5 (credentials + optional OAuth) | Session/JWT, middleware RBAC, works on Vercel edge; credentials keeps demo login frictionless | Clerk/Auth0 (external dependency, less to demonstrate) |
| D5 | Server Actions + Route Handlers hybrid | Actions for mutations (progressive enhancement), Route Handlers for the public REST-ish API + exports | tRPC (adds surface without payoff for a trial) |
| D6 | Multi-tenant via `Organization` | Demonstrates real SaaS data-isolation & maturity | Single-tenant (weaker signal) |
| D7 | TanStack Query for client cache + optimistic updates | Required by brief; pairs with Server Actions for mutations | SWR (fine, but brief names TanStack) |
| D8 | Tenancy enforced in a data-access layer (`lib/dal`) | Every query is org-scoped in one place → no accidental cross-tenant leak | ad-hoc `where` clauses (leak risk) |

## Current status (Last updated: post-M9)

M0–M9 are complete. Every milestone from M3 onward was verified by actually running the
application (Playwright against a live dev server), not just by a green build — that discipline
caught every real bug in this project, none of which a type-checker or linter would have found
(see §8 and §11 for specifics). `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` (69 passing), `test:e2e` (12 passing),
and `build` are all green as of the last full run. Remaining work is M10: a line-by-line audit
against `MASTER_REQUIREMENTS.md` and a harsh self-review against the brief's own rubric.

---

## 5. Assumptions (to reconcile if the real brief arrives)

1. No hard time-box given → optimise for demonstrated breadth + depth, not raw speed.
2. Deployment target is Vercel + Supabase (most common, best DX). Swappable.
3. A single demo Organization is seeded; the model supports many.
4. "Export PDF" = server-generated PDF of the current filtered ticket view + a per-ticket PDF.
5. English-only, no i18n required (structure allows adding it).

---

## 6. How to resume (for a future session)

1. Read this file §3–§4.
2. `npm install` at repo root.
3. `cp .env.example .env` and set `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` + `AUTH_SECRET`.
4. `npm run db:reset` (migrate + seed).
5. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000, log in with the demo creds in `SUBMISSION/README.md`.
6. Continue from the "Next action" in §4.

---

## 7. BRIEF RECONCILIATION (authoritative — supersedes earlier assumptions)

> The real Digital Heroes brief (`Digital_Heroes_Full_Stack_Developer_Trial.pdf`, "The Builder's
> Handbook") was received mid-M0 and read in full. It **validates the stack and approach** and adds
> hard requirements. This section is the source of truth where it conflicts with §0–§6.

**Confirmed by brief:** Next.js App Router · TS strict (no `any`) · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · Postgres
(Supabase/Neon) **or SQLite for simple apps** · Prisma · Auth.js · Zod on every boundary · Vercel ·
TanStack Query / server actions · ESLint+Prettier+Vitest/Playwright+GitHub Actions. Milestone builds,
spec-first, schema-first, 4-states-first, ⌘K palette — all already planned.

**Environment reality (locked after scaffold):** create-next-app installed **Next.js 16.2.10 · React
19.2.4 · Tailwind v4**. Next 16 has breaking changes vs. training data — consult
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing app code. Remove scaffold's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` from
the public repo (reads as AI scaffolding).

**Database (final):** `provider = "sqlite"` committed → zero-service local run for reviewers. Prisma
client uses the **libSQL driver adapter** so production runs on **Turso** (SQLite-compatible,
serverless, persistent, free tier) with the *identical* schema. `docs/deployment.md` also documents the
one-line switch to Postgres/Supabase. Rationale: max verifiability + brief's zero-friction demand +
real persistence on Vercel.

**New decisions from the brief:**

| # | Decision | Driven by brief section |
|---|----------|-------------------------|
| D9  | Roles = **OWNER · ADMIN · AGENT · VIEWER** (4) | §08 "owner/admin/member/viewer" |
| D10 | **Email verification** gates write access; **password reset** via single-use hashed token (20-min TTL, invalidated on use) | §08 Auth & Access |
| D11 | **OAuth Google + GitHub** via Auth.js, lit up when env present; passwords hashed with **bcrypt cost 12** (pure-JS `bcryptjs`, serverless-safe; meets "bcrypt ≥12") | §08 |
| D12 | **Keyset/cursor pagination** on `(sortKey, id)`; default page size 25, hard cap 100 | §08 Finding Data |
| D13 | **Soft-delete** (`deletedAt`) on Ticket; mutations return the mutated record | §08 Data & CRUD |
| D14 | **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) in `next.config`; CSRF via Auth.js + same-site + server-action origin checks | §08 Trust & Safety |
| D15 | **`src/` directory** layout: `src/{app,components,lib,server,types}` | §10 Repo Structure |
| D16 | Full **SEO**: per-route metadata, canonical, robots.ts, sitemap.ts, `opengraph-image.tsx` (ImageResponse 1200×630), Twitter cards, JSON-LD (SoftwareApplication + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList), self-hosted **Inter** via `next/font` | §14 SEO |
| D17 | Public **marketing surface**: real landing page (H1 value prop, features, screenshots, one CTA) + docs pages + FAQ; app lives under `(app)` group behind auth | §14 Content & Discovery |
| D18 | **Streamed** CSV/PDF export (survive 30s gateway); **bulk actions** with select-all-across-pages + confirm; keyboard `⌘K`, `j/k`, `/`, `?` cheat-sheet | §08 Beyond Basics |
| D19 | Deliverables: demo login in README, **credit Digital Heroes**, `docs/case-study.md`, `docs/demo-script.md` (60–90s), tagged **v1.0.0** | §11, §16, §22 |

**Evaluation weights (score budget — spend accordingly, M10):**
Product Quality & Functionality **20** · UI/UX Craft **15** · Code Quality & Architecture **15** ·
Deployment & Reliability **12** · Documentation **10** · GitHub Professionalism **10** ·
SEO & Discoverability **10** · Originality & Attention to Detail **8**.

**Hard rules (non-negotiable):** TS strict · real DB (not localStorage) · real auth · server-side
validation · secrets only in env. **Common-mistake avoidance:** no default README · no single squashed
commit (atomic conventional commits) · deploy survives hard refresh · OG image renders · zero console
errors/warnings · all 4 states everywhere · responsive from 320px · strip AI comments/TODOs/dead code ·
`.env` gitignored · tagged release.

**UI hard specs to hardcode as tokens (§07):** 4/8px spacing · type scale 12/14/16/20/24/32/48 (body
16, lh 1.5, headings 1.2) · radius 8 default /6 inputs /12 cards /9999 pills · tap target ≥44px · AA
contrast 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/UI · app shell ≤1280px, prose ≤680px · motion 150–250ms ease
`cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`, 300ms cap, honor reduced-motion · Inter + mono for numbers · focus ring
2px accent +2px offset on `:focus-visible` · breakpoints 640/768/1024/1280 mobile-first.

**Open decision to raise with user:** commit-trailer AI attribution vs. brief's "own every line" — ask
before finalizing git history.

**Resolved:** user chose no AI co-author trailer (see §9 handoff record). All commits are authored
solely under the user's git identity, conventional-commit style, atomic per logical unit.

## 8. Session handoff to Antigravity + post-handoff audit (this session)

Work was hand-milestoned M0→M2 by Claude Code, then handed to **Google Antigravity** (via
`docs/HANDOFF_ANTIGRAVITY.md`) to continue M3→M6. Antigravity delivered all four milestones in one
extended session (25 commits: `c5331ef`…`12933d4`). A follow-up Claude Code session then **audited
that work end-to-end** — not by reading code, but by actually running the app (Playwright against a
live dev server, real login, real clicks) — before continuing to M7. Findings below.

### Verdict: M3–M6 substantially correct and functional

Confirmed working end-to-end against real seeded data (not just "renders"):

- Login/session/RBAC — proper `authjs.session-token` cookie, JWT claims, org-scoped access.
- Dashboard — 4 KPI cards + 3 charts (volume line, status donut, priority bars) + agent leaderboard,
  all computed from real aggregated ticket data.
- Tickets — list, **debounced server-side search** (URL-driven `?q=`), **column-header sort**
  (`?sort=status.asc`, verified order actually changes), **status/priority filter** via native
  `<select>` (`?status=OPEN`, verified 18/18 returned rows genuinely `OPEN`), **pagination**
  (`?page=2`, verified genuinely different rows), detail view with timeline, comment posting.
- CSV export — real file download (`tickets_export.csv`), respects active filters.
- PDF export — real per-ticket PDF download (`ticket-1062.pdf`).
- Contacts — list, create (redirects to detail + success toast; confirmed via server log + toast,
  not just UI inspection).
- Dark mode — **properly designed**, not inverted: elevated surfaces, desaturated accent, persists
  via `next-themes`, zero flash.
- Mobile responsive — no horizontal scroll at 375px; working slide-in sidebar drawer with backdrop.
- Auth pages — register, forgot-password render and are reachable.

### Bugs found during the audit and fixed

1. **P0 — entire authenticated app crashed on every load.** `src/components/app-shell/topbar.tsx`
   is a Server Component that inlined a `<Button onClick={...}>` (dispatching a synthetic
   Cmd/Ctrl+K keydown to open the command palette). Passing an event handler from a Server
   Component throws `Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.` — this
   fired on literally every page load post-login. **Fix:** extracted the button into
   `src/components/app-shell/search-trigger.tsx` (`"use client"`), matching the codebase's existing
   pattern of small client islands (`SignOutButton`, `ThemeToggle`). `Topbar` stays a Server
   Component. Verified via Next's own dev error overlay before/after.
2. **P1 — command palette crashed the instant you typed.** `src/components/ui/command.tsx`'s
   `CommandDialog` (shadcn-generated) wrapped children in `Dialog`/`DialogContent` but never
   rendered the `<Command>` (cmdk `CommandPrimitive`) root, so `CommandInput`/`CommandList` had no
   context/store to read — `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'subscribe')`
   on the first keystroke. **Fix:** wrapped `children` in `<Command shouldFilter={false}>` inside
   `CommandDialog` (`shouldFilter={false}` because `CommandPalette` already does server-side
   search via `performGlobalSearch`, so cmdk's own client fuzzy-filter must not double-filter).
   Verified: typing "ticket" now returns real, live, grouped, zero-error results.
3. **Infra — M1's own test/format tooling had silently gone missing** (root-caused to *this
   project's own earlier Claude Code session*, not Antigravity): `vitest`, `@playwright/test`,
   `@testing-library/*`, `jsdom`, `prettier`, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`, `tsx`, `dotenv` were
   present in an `npm install` I ran during M1, but never made it into the committed
   `package.json`/`package-lock.json` — most likely clobbered by a subsequent `shadcn init`
   invocation regenerating the manifest. Net effect: on a **fresh clone**, `npm test`,
   `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm run format` would all fail with "command not found," and
   `db:seed` only "worked" via `npx`'s ad-hoc temp-install fallback. **Fix:** reinstalled all
   fourteen packages explicitly, pinning `@vitejs/plugin-react` to the `^4` line (the `latest`/v6
   resolves to a Babel-8-based chain that conflicts with shadcn's Babel-7 chain — real,
   reproducible `npm error ERESOLVE`). Removed the now-unneeded `@types/bcryptjs` stub (bcryptjs
   ships its own types). Typecheck/lint/build reverified green after.
4. **Cleanup — stale/leftover `any` usage in dashboard charts.** `priority-chart.tsx` and
   `status-distribution.tsx` had a file-level `/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */`
   plus several redundant per-line disables and `as any` casts around Recharts' `Tooltip`/`Legend`/
   `XAxis` formatter callbacks — almost certainly left over from an earlier draft before the "fix:
   resolve strict typing issues in Recharts" commit, since ESLint reported them as *unused*
   directives (i.e., nothing underneath them actually needed the exemption anymore). Replaced with
   properly typed callbacks using Recharts' own exported `ValueType`/`NameType` types — zero `any`,
   zero disables, matching the project's hard rule.

### False alarms during the audit (not app bugs — recorded so they aren't rediscovered)

- An early hand-rolled Playwright test used an **unanchored** `waitForURL(/dashboard/)` regex,
  which matches `/login?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard` too (the substring "dashboard" appears in the
  query string) — produced false "login failed" readings.
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`'s `clientIp()` falls back to the literal string `"unknown"` when no
  `x-forwarded-for`/`x-real-ip` header is present — true for **all** local Playwright/curl traffic.
  Repeated local test runs against one long-lived dev server collapsed into a single shared
  `login:unknown:demo@deskly.app` bucket and legitimately tripped the 5-attempts/15-min limit,
  which looked identical to a broken login until traced. **Not fixed yet** — noted as a real,
  if minor, hardening item for M7 (see below); it isn't a functional bug for the seeded demo flow,
  but on any deployment that doesn't guarantee a trusted reverse proxy sets `x-forwarded-for`
  (or where a client can forge it), it's a soft spot worth a defense-in-depth pass.
  On Vercel specifically this resolves correctly (`x-forwarded-for` is platform-set and trustworthy).
- On Windows/Git Bash, `kill $pid` / `pkill -f "next dev"` against a process started with
  `npm run dev &` **did not** reliably terminate the real underlying `node.exe` — it kept serving
  on port 3000 under its original PID with all in-memory state (including the rate limiter) intact,
  making a "fresh restart" look identical to the stale process. Use `netstat -ano | grep :3000` to
  find the real PID and `taskkill //F //PID <pid>` to actually kill it on this platform.
- Contact creation appeared to "hang" on `/contacts/new` — it doesn't; `router.push` to the new
  contact's detail page plus the `sonner` success toast both fire correctly, a screenshot taken
  ~800ms after submit just caught the transition mid-flight (Next's own "Rendering…" dev indicator
  was visible in the capture).
- "Sort" and "filter" controls appeared absent to a first pass of Playwright selectors expecting
  shadcn `Select`/button components — they're implemented instead as semantic `<Link>` elements
  (sort headers) and native `<select>` (status/priority filters), which is a legitimate,
  progressively-enhanced, fully-accessible choice, not a gap. Verified functionally correct once
  selectors were corrected.

### Follow-ups carried into M7+

- [x] Harden `clientIp()` in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — documented the trust boundary (safe on
      Vercel, spoofable/shared-bucket without a trusted proxy) directly in the function's doc
      comment; also added rate limiting to `changePasswordAction` (was previously the only
      secret-verifying action without one).
- [ ] No automated tests exist yet for any of M3–M7 (expected — that's M8). All manual verification
      so far (this section and §9 below) is a one-time Playwright-driven pass, not a substitute for
      the Vitest/Playwright suite still to be written.

---

## 9. M7 — Settings, RBAC admin, audit log, analytics (this session, Claude Code)

Built directly (not handed off), following the same discipline as the M3–M6 audit: every flow was
driven end-to-end with Playwright against a live dev server before being called done, not just
typechecked/built. Two false alarms surfaced during that verification and are recorded here so a
future session doesn't re-chase them (see "Gotchas" below) — both traced back to fixed `waitForTimeout`
delays in throwaway test scripts racing a cold Turbopack compile or a `revalidatePath`, not real bugs.

### What was missing and is now built

- **`/analytics`** — the sidebar linked here since M3 but the route never existed (404). Built with
  a 7/30/90-day range selector; the dashboard's analytics DAL functions (`getDashboardKPIs`,
  `getTicketVolumeSeries`, `getAgentLeaderboard`) were parametrized (`windowDays`, `limit`) rather
  than duplicated, so Dashboard keeps its fixed 30-day glance and Analytics reuses the same queries.
- **Settings shell** (`/settings`) — RBAC-gated left sub-nav; items an actor can't reach
  (Organization/Members/Audit log) are hidden, not just disabled, mirroring what the server actions
  themselves enforce.
- **Profile** — update name/avatar; change password (current-password verification, its own rate
  limit, round-trip-tested: changed a real seeded user's password, logged out, logged back in with
  the *new* password, then reverted it so the seed stays predictable).
- **Organization** — rename the workspace, gated to `org:edit` (Owner/Admin).
- **Members** — add (no email provider, so it surfaces a claim-your-account link the same way
  registration does — reuses the `PasswordResetToken` table with a longer 7-day TTL), change role,
  remove. RBAC rules, enforced identically client-side (for UX) and server-side (source of truth):
  only an Owner may grant Owner/Admin; an actor may otherwise only manage strictly lower-ranked
  members; an Owner may manage a peer Owner but never themselves; the last remaining Owner can never
  be demoted or removed. Removal detaches (`orgId: null`) rather than hard-deletes, since `Comment`
  has `onDelete: Cascade` on its author — deleting a user outright would have silently destroyed
  their ticket comment history.
- **Audit log** (`/settings/audit`) — paginated, most-recent-first, filterable by entity type; every
  new mutation above writes to it (`profile.updated`, `password.changed`, `organization.updated`,
  `member.invited`, `member.role_changed`, `member.removed` were added to `AUDIT_ACTIONS`).
- **`/onboarding`** — `requireOrg()` already redirected any signed-in-but-orgless user here (a
  removed member, or a first-time OAuth sign-in), but the page didn't exist — a latent dead-end
  that member removal would now actively trigger. Built as a minimal explanation + sign-out; there's
  no self-serve create-workspace flow, by design (single-org-per-user model for this build).

### Verified end-to-end (Playwright, zero page errors)

Login as Owner → settings nav shows all four sections → profile rename persists → password change
correctly rejects a wrong current password → organization name loads correctly → members list (6
seeded) → add member shows the dev-mode invite link → role change → remove (confirmed via a **fresh**
page reload showing 6 rows again, not just the in-page state) → audit log shows the resulting
`member.invited`/`member.role_changed`/`member.removed` rows, and entity filter narrows to exactly
those 3 → analytics page renders 31 chart SVGs and the range selector updates the URL and the
on-page "(7d)" labels. Separately: full password-change round trip (change → log out → log in with
the new password → succeeds → revert).

### Gotchas hit while verifying (test-script issues, not app bugs — don't re-chase these)

- A `waitForTimeout(1500)` after clicking Sign in raced a **cold Turbopack compile** of `/login`
  right after an `rm -rf .next` (observed taking 3.1s on that specific request) and produced a false
  "login is broken" reading. Fixed by polling (retry `goto('/dashboard')` a few times with short
  waits) instead of trusting a single fixed delay — the same class of issue as the earlier M3–M6
  audit's `waitForURL` regex problem, different mechanism.
- A member-removal check read the table **800ms** after confirming the AlertDialog and saw the
  stale row count (7, not 6) even though the audit log already showed the removal had executed
  server-side. A **fresh page navigation** a few seconds later showed the correct 6 rows. Don't
  trust an in-page count taken immediately after a mutation without allowing for
  `revalidatePath` + client re-render; reload or wait longer.

---

## 10. M8 — Testing (Vitest + Playwright)

**69 unit/integration tests, 12 E2E tests, all green.** Built for value, not coverage percentage —
every test either locks down security-critical logic or exercises the flow the brief calls out by
name ("create -> filter -> export").

### Unit tests (`src/lib/**/*.test.ts`, 51 tests)

RBAC (`permissions.test.ts`) — `can()` per role including the "OWNER gets everything, even
unlisted actions" case; `outranks()`; `assignableRoles()` never returns anything ranked above the
actor. Validation boundaries (`auth.test.ts`, `ticket.test.ts`, `member.test.ts`,
`profile.test.ts`) — exact min/max character boundaries (7 vs 8, 72 vs 73), not just "some valid /
some invalid" cases; rejecting enum values outside the known set (never trust a role sent from the
client, even in a test). The rate limiter (`rate-limit.test.ts`) — window reset uses
`vi.useFakeTimers()` to advance real time deterministically rather than sleeping. Tokens/passwords
(`tokens.test.ts`, `password.test.ts`) — hash determinism, per-hash salting, and the bcrypt cost-12
requirement asserted directly against the hash's own `$2b$12$` prefix.

### Integration test (`test/integration/tenant-isolation.test.ts`, 5 tests)

The one property that matters most in a multi-tenant app: org A can never see org B's rows. Real
Prisma queries against a **disposable SQLite file** with the actual migrations applied via
`prisma migrate deploy` (not mocks) — two organizations, one ticket each, asserting
`findFirst({ id: ticketB.id, orgId: orgA.id })` returns `null` (the exact DAL pattern used
everywhere in the app) and that per-org ticket numbering can collide (both orgs have a "#1") without
conflict. Cleanup is best-effort (`try/catch`) because Windows can hold a SQLite file handle open
briefly after `$disconnect()` resolves — a lingering handle must never fail the suite; the next
run's `beforeAll` clears it anyway.

### E2E (`e2e/*.spec.ts`, Playwright, 12 tests)

`auth.spec.ts` — unauthenticated redirect with callback URL preserved, wrong-password error,
successful login, sign-out. `tickets.spec.ts` — the brief's named critical path: create a ticket,
find it via server-side search, export CSV (asserts a real download event and filename, not just a
click); plus commenting and status-change persistence across a reload. `rbac.spec.ts` — a viewer
doesn't see "New ticket," the settings sub-nav omits Organization/Members/Audit for a viewer but
shows all four for an Owner, and — the one that actually matters — a viewer who **navigates straight
to `/settings/members` by URL** gets the real not-found render, not just a hidden button. A hidden
control is not a security boundary; this test would have caught it if it were.

### Two real fixes that came out of building this suite (not test-only changes)

1. **`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`** — a full E2E run reuses ~6 seeded accounts across 12 specs, all
   against one server process's in-memory bucket, and legitimately exceeds the 5-attempts/15-min
   login limit partway through. Rather than weaken the limit, added an `E2E_TESTING` escape hatch
   that only `playwright.config.ts`'s `webServer.env` ever sets — structurally unreachable in any
   real deployment, so production behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.
2. **`sidebar.tsx` / `settings-nav.tsx`** — two unlabeled `<nav>` landmarks on the same page
   (app sidebar + settings sub-nav) were indistinguishable to both assistive tech and a Playwright
   query trying to scope to one of them. Added `aria-label="Main"` / `aria-label="Settings"` — a
   real accessibility fix, not a test-only workaround (confirmed the bug first: an early RBAC test
   assertion was trivially passing against the *wrong* nav element and not actually testing
   anything, because both navs happened to omit the same strings).

### Gotchas hit while building this suite (test-infra issues, not app bugs)

- `import "server-only"` in `src/lib/auth/password.ts`/`tokens.ts`/`db.ts` isn't a real resolvable
  npm package — Next.js's bundler special-cases that bare import at build time. Vitest runs outside
  that bundler and crashes on it. Fixed with a `resolve.alias` in `vitest.config.ts` pointing it at
  a one-line no-op stub (`test/stubs/server-only.ts`) — the guard still does its real job inside the
  actual Next.js build; only the test runner needed the alias.
- `notFound()` called deep inside a Server Component tree does **not** reliably flip the top-level
  HTTP status to 404 under RSC streaming — Next may have already committed a 200 for the shell
  before the nested boundary is reached. The rendered not-found UI *is* correct (verified via
  screenshot) and *is* the real security boundary; asserting `response.status() === 404` was the
  wrong test. Assert on rendered content for this pattern, not the top-level HTTP status.
- Same cold-Turbopack-compile-races-a-fixed-`waitForTimeout` issue as the M3–M6 audit (§8), now
  fixed once, centrally, in `e2e/helpers.ts`'s shared `login()` — poll `/dashboard` a few times
  with short waits rather than trust one fixed delay after clicking submit.
  **Superseded by §11 below** — the polling-goto fix here was itself incomplete; the real root
  cause was more specific than "cold compile."

## 11. M9 — Docs, SEO, deploy config, and the SUBMISSION package

Built the entire product-facing and reviewer-facing surface that M0–M8 didn't touch: the
marketing site, every doc the brief names, full SEO, CI, GitHub templates, and the submission
package. Tagged **v1.0.0** at the end.

### What was built

- **Marketing site** (`src/app/(marketing)/`) — a real landing page (specific H1, a feature grid
  grounded in what's actually built, one primary CTA, a real product screenshot — not a mockup),
  a docs hub (`/docs`) linking to getting-started/features/deployment (each a crawlable static
  page with breadcrumb markup), and an FAQ page with eight real questions. Its own layout
  (header/footer), separate from the authenticated `(app)` shell — the two surfaces share almost
  nothing, so sharing a layout would have meant conditionals in one file instead of two simple ones.
- **Real screenshots** — captured with Playwright against the actual running app (dashboard,
  tickets, ticket detail, analytics, command palette, settings/members, dark mode, mobile),
  used by the landing page hero, the README, and `docs/screenshots/`. Not stock photos, not
  mockups — satisfies the brief's "no lorem, no placeholder" literally.
- **SEO** — `robots.ts` (allows the public site, blocks `/api` and the authenticated app),
  `sitemap.ts` (the six public pages), a generated favicon/apple-icon/OG-image set (`next/og`'s
  `ImageResponse`, matching the app's actual indigo accent rather than a static asset that could
  drift from it), and JSON-LD (`SoftwareApplication` on the landing page, `FAQPage` on `/faq`
  mirroring the visible Q&A verbatim, `BreadcrumbList` on each docs page matching its on-screen
  trail) — all server-rendered into the initial HTML via a shared `<JsonLd>` component, never
  client-injected.
- **Documentation** — README rewrite (pitch, screenshots, quick start, demo credentials, env
  table, roadmap — nothing left from the `create-next-app` default), `docs/architecture.md`
  (ER diagram matching the *actual* current schema, not the earlier plan.md draft — `Tag`/
  `SavedView` are noted as modeled-but-not-yet-exposed-in-the-UI rather than silently implied to
  be finished features), `docs/API.md` (all 20 server actions + 3 route handlers, gathered by
  grepping the codebase for `"use server"` files rather than working from memory), `docs/deployment.md`,
  `docs/testing.md`, `docs/decisions.md` (a short, curated list — distinct from this file's full
  chronological log), `docs/case-study.md`, `docs/demo-script.md` (a timed shot list, since a
  video itself can't be generated), `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format), `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **CI & GitHub hygiene** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (a fast `checks` job — typecheck, lint,
  unit+integration tests, build — gating a separate `e2e` job so a flaky/slow E2E run doesn't
  block the cheap, reliable checks), bug report + feature request issue templates, a PR template
  matching CONTRIBUTING's own pre-push checklist.
- **`SUBMISSION/README.md`** — the single entry point a reviewer needs: links (with honest
  placeholders for the deploy URL and demo video, since those need the user's own action),
  demo credentials for all three seeded roles, the one-paragraph pitch, feature list, tech
  stack, architecture summary, folder structure, known limitations (stated plainly — no email
  delivery, offset not keyset pagination, Tag/SavedView UI not built, single-instance rate
  limiting), future improvements, and an honest "time spent" section naming the AI-paired
  workflow directly rather than obscuring it (the brief explicitly asks for this).

### A real, non-trivial bug found while building this milestone

**Root cause, not just a symptom fix, for the login flakiness first patched in §8.** While
capturing screenshots against a freshly rebuilt dev server, login started failing **consistently**
(not intermittently) — 15 straight attempts, real server-side success every time (a 303 with a
valid cookie, confirmed via a raw diagnostic script), zero cookies ever landing in the browser.
The actual cause: the login helper called `page.goto("/dashboard")` **immediately** after
clicking submit, in a retry loop. Starting a new navigation while one is still in flight
**cancels the pending one** in the browser — which discarded the response carrying `Set-Cookie`
before it was ever applied. This isn't a race that more retries fix; each retry *was* what broke
it, over and over. The §8 entry's "poll with short waits" fix reduced how often this triggered
without addressing why — it happened to avoid the interrupt often enough to look like a timing
issue. Root-caused by comparing a script that succeeded (plain click-and-wait, no competing
navigation) against the retry-loop version (which failed) and noticing the *only* structural
difference was the interrupting `goto()`. Fixed properly in the committed `e2e/helpers.ts` by
replacing the retry-loop with `waitForURL`, which observes the click's own navigation instead of
racing it — the 12-test E2E suite got measurably faster as a side effect, not just more reliable.

### Verified before tagging

`typecheck`, `lint`, `test` (69/69), `test:e2e` (12/12), and `build` all green in one final,
uninterrupted run — not stitched together from earlier partial runs. Database reseeded to
canonical state afterward so the tag doesn't carry any test-created scratch data.

### Known gaps going into M10

- CI's `e2e` job has been carefully constructed (env vars cross-checked against `src/env.ts`,
  migration commands matched to what's verified locally) but **not observed running on GitHub's
  actual hosted runners** — pushing is still blocked on a local git-credential prompt. Worth
  watching closely on the first real push; documented as a known limitation in `SUBMISSION/README.md`
  rather than silently assumed to work.
- `SUBMISSION/README.md`'s live deployment URL and demo video link are placeholders — both need
  the user's own action (an actual `vercel deploy` and an actual screen recording) that this
  session cannot perform on their behalf.
